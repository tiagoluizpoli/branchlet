A interactive CLI tool for creating and managing Git worktrees with an easy to use interface.

## Features

- **Quick Commands**: Jump directly to specific actions via command line
- **Smart Configuration**: Project-specific and global configuration support
- **File Management**: Automatically copy configuration files to new worktrees
- **Post-Create Actions**: Run custom commands after worktree creation

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g branchlet
```

## Quick Start

Run Branchlet in any Git repository:

```bash
branchlet
```

This opens an interactive menu where you can:
- Create new worktrees
- List existing worktrees
- Delete worktrees
- Configure settings

## Commands

### Interactive Menu (Default)
```bash
branchlet
```
Opens the main menu with all available options.

### Direct Commands
```bash
branchlet create    # Go directly to worktree creation
branchlet list      # List all worktrees
branchlet delete    # Go directly to worktree deletion
branchlet settings  # Open settings menu
```

### Options
```bash
branchlet --help     # Show help information
branchlet --version  # Show version number
branchlet -m create  # Set initial mode
```

### Non-Interactive (Scriptable) CLI

Pass flags to skip the interactive prompts entirely. The three core concepts map directly to flags:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-n, --name <name>` | Worktree directory name |
| `-s, --source <branch>` | Source branch to create from |
| `-b, --branch <branch>` | New branch name (defaults to `-n` when omitted) |

```bash
# Create a worktree — new branch defaults to the worktree name
branchlet create -n my-feature -s main

# Create a worktree with an explicit branch name different from the directory
branchlet create -n ticket-3121-backend -s main -b feature/ticket-3121

# Create multiple sibling worktrees from the same source branch
# (each gets its own branch, so there's no checkout conflict)
branchlet create -n digit3121-backend  -s main -b feat/digit3121-backend
branchlet create -n digit3121-frontend -s main -b feat/digit3121-frontend

# List worktrees as JSON
branchlet list --json

# Delete a worktree by name
branchlet delete -n my-feature

# Force-delete a worktree by path
branchlet delete -p /path/to/worktree -f
```

Successful `create` output:
```
/path/to/worktree
  source: main
  branch: my-feature
```

## Configuration

Branchlet looks for configuration files in this order:
1. `.branchlet.json` in your repo's root (project-specific)
2. `~/.branchlet/settings.json` (global configuration)

### Configuration Options

Create a `.branchlet.json` file in your project root or configure global settings:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raghavpillai/branchlet/main/schema.json",
  "worktreeCopyPatterns": [".env*", ".vscode/**"],
  "worktreeCopyIgnores": ["**/node_modules/**", "**/dist/**", "**/.git/**"],
  "worktreePathTemplate": "$BASE_PATH.worktree",
  "postCreateCmd": ["npm install", "npm run db:generate"],
  "terminalCommand": "code .",
  "deleteBranchWithWorktree": true
}
```

#### Configuration Fields

- **`worktreeCopyPatterns`**: Files/directories to copy to new worktrees (supports glob patterns)
  - Default: `[".env*", ".vscode/**"]`
  - Examples: `["*.json", "config/**", ".env.local"]`

- **`worktreeCopyIgnores`**: Files/directories to exclude when copying (supports glob patterns)
  - Default: `["**/node_modules/**", "**/dist/**", "**/.git/**", "**/Thumbs.db", "**/.DS_Store"]`

- **`worktreePathTemplate`**: Base template for worktree directories; Branchlet appends the generated worktree directory name once
  - Default: `"$BASE_PATH.worktree"`
  - Variables: `$BASE_PATH`, `$WORKTREE_PATH`, `$BRANCH_NAME`, `$SOURCE_BRANCH`
  - Ordinary-relative templates retain their current behavior and resolve from the repository’s parent directory: `"worktrees/$BRANCH_NAME"`, `"$BASE_PATH-branches/$BRANCH_NAME"`
  - `~` and `~/...` resolve from the runtime user’s home directory: `"~/worktrees/$BRANCH_NAME"`
  - Native absolute paths retain their root: `"/tmp/worktrees"` on POSIX or `"C:\\worktrees"` on Windows
  - Only the `~` and `~/...` home aliases expand. `~user/...`, `~~/...`, `~\\...`, `$HOME`, and `%USERPROFILE%` are ordinary template text; Branchlet does not interpolate environment variables.

- **`postCreateCmd`**: Commands to run after creating a worktree. Runs in the new worktree directory.
  - Default: `[]`
  - Examples: `["npm install"]`, `["pnpm install", "pnpm build"]`
  - Variables supported in commands: `$BASE_PATH`, `$WORKTREE_PATH`, `$BRANCH_NAME`, `$SOURCE_BRANCH`

- **`terminalCommand`**: Command to open terminal/editor in the new worktree. Runs in the new worktree directory.
  - Default: `""`
  - Examples: `"code ."`, `"cursor ."`, `"zed ."`

- **`deleteBranchWithWorktree`**: Whether to also delete the associated git branch when deleting a worktree
  - Default: `false`
  - When enabled, deleting a worktree will also delete its branch (with safety checks)
  - Shows warnings for branches with unpushed commits or uncommitted changes

### Template Variables

Available in `worktreePathTemplate`, `postCreateCmd`, and `terminalCommand`:

- `$BASE_PATH`: Base name of your repository
- `$WORKTREE_PATH`: Full path to the new worktree
- `$BRANCH_NAME`: Name of the new branch
- `$SOURCE_BRANCH`: Name of the source branch

## Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow

1. **Navigate to your Git repository**
   ```bash
   cd my-project
   ```

2. **Start Branchlet**
   ```bash
   branchlet
   ```

3. **Create a worktree**
   - Select "Create new worktree"
   - Enter directory name (e.g., `feature-auth`)
   - Choose source branch (e.g., `main`)
   - Enter new branch name (e.g., `feature/authentication`)
   - Confirm creation

### Project-Specific Configuration

Create `.branchlet.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raghavpillai/branchlet/main/schema.json",
  "worktreeCopyPatterns": [
    ".env.local",
    ".vscode/**",
    "package.json",
    "tsconfig.json"
  ],
  "worktreePathTemplate": "worktrees/$BRANCH_NAME",
  "postCreateCmd": [
    "npm install",
    "npm run db:populate"
  ],
  "terminalCommand": "code .",
  "deleteBranchWithWorktree": true
}
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.0.0 or higher
- Git installed and available in PATH
- Operating system: macOS, Linux, or Windows
